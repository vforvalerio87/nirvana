Welcome to the 'Nirvana' Browser Application Framework Concept

Key features:
- Promise-based
- Uses Proxy for reactive rendering, under-the-hood fetching and caching of state

Because 'view !== f(state)'; actually 'view === async f(await state)'

To install dependencies:
`npm install`

To run:
`gulp`
